# Collie VS Code Extension

Unofficial VS Code integration for the Collie templating language. This repository currently tracks the MVP milestones outlined in `mvp-implementation-plan.md`.

## Development Scripts

- `pnpm build` – bundle the extension with esbuild
- `pnpm watch` – rebuild on file change
- `pnpm package` – create a `.vsix` via `vsce`
- `pnpm lint` – run TypeScript for type checking only
